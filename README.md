# GymManagement-OOPS-

Using fundamental concepts of Object Orient Programming, we have created a Gym Management Program that resembles a real life gym app, using an interactive terminal based interface.

*Exercise* - There are two kinds of exercises, Strength and Cardio.

*Person* - The gym consists of 2 different hierarchy of people, Member of the Gym and Gym Trainer.

*Routine* - Routine tells us about which set of exercises to be done by a member on a particular day of the week.

*Gym* - This contains all the data about the gym, which is managed by the admin.
